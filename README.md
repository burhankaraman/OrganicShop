# Organic Shop

This project demonstrates a simple e-commerce application for an imaginary organic shop. It is built with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 4 as the final project.

## What you will learn

Use Angular and Firebase to build real-time serverless applications
Think like a software engineer
Write clean and testable code
Design classes and modules with proper boundaries

## Important Note
Before running this application on your machine, create a Firebase project. You need to replace the Firebase settings I've defined in /src/environments with the settings of your own Firebase project. You can import the OShopDB.json file directly into the your newly created firebase database to create the database.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
